# remoclipbo securely copies contents of your clipboard to a remote machine
# without the need for virtual KVM software like Sharemouse, Synergy, etc.
#
# Requirements: MacOS using bash, pbcopy and pbpaste commands
# See https://github.com/rkulla/remoclipbo for how to automate it with shortcuts!
#
# Usage:
#   On BOTH machines, put remoclipbo in your $PATH and make it executable
#   Simply run it:
#     $ remoclipbo 
#   will write the contents of your clipboard to ~/remote-clipboard.txt
#   and then scp it to the remote machine's ~/remote-clipboard.txt.
#
#   Running:
#     $ remoclipbo -c
#   will read ~/remote-clipboard.txt and copy its contents to the clipboard.
#
# make sure to edit the value of `REMOTE` below, to point to the host to copy to. Ex:
#   On your work machine, ~/bin/remoclipbo should exist but copies to your home machine.
#   On your home machine, ~/bin/remoclipbo should exist but copies to your work machine.

REMOTE='<user@host>:~/' # Edit this line to point to the host to copy to
FILENAME="$HOME/remote-clipboard.txt"

if [[ "$1" == "-c" ]]; then
    # Copy the contents of remote-clipboard.txt to clipboard
    pbcopy < "$FILENAME"
else
    # Copy clipboard contents to remote-clipboard.txt and send it to the remote machine
    pbpaste > "$FILENAME"
    sleep 1 # Ensures pbpaste captures content before sending
    scp "$FILENAME" "$REMOTE"
fi
